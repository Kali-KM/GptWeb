# Chatbot Powered by OpenAI

This is a Flask-based web application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to create a chatbot that can answer user's questions about Python programming. 

## Setup

To set up this application, you will need to run it in a virtual environment. 

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. In the terminal, run `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment.
3. Activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`, on windows `.\.venv\Scripts\activate.`
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file, which should be located in the project directory. The `.env` file should contain your API key in the following format:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Usage

To run the application, make sure that the virtual environment is active and run `python gptWeb.py` in the terminal. Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

When prompted, enter your Python programming question and the chatbot will provide an answer generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 API. If you want to use the Python teaching mode, simply navigate to `http://localhost:5000/python` in your browser to access the teaching interface.
